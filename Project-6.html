                    <h4>We design for a system that provides an engaging activity for families to experience dioramas in a new way at Carnegie Museum of Art. We specifically looked into how human impacts influence ecosystem in individual dioramas and how we could educate families to be more aware of environmental issues. The entire project took about a month from scratch to finish, and we wanted to create a system that incorporates both psychical and interactive digital technologies which apply to most of the dioramas in the museum. Due to the short period, we only focus on one particular diorama for addressing our concepts. We decided to tackle Allegheny National Forest diorama and how would invasive species affects the ecosystem as a whole in 15 years.</h4>

                    <p>
                    <li>Parents and children moved at different speeds throughout the exhibition.</li>

                    <h2>Focus</h2>
                     <h4>Based on observations and discussions with museum staff and elementary school educators, we decided to focus on 5-11 years old children and utilize:
                    <p><li>Incorporate the concept of human impacts inside the ecosystems presented by the dioramas</li>
                    <li>Observation and inquiry to promote conversation</li>
                    <li>Use open-ended questions to provide opportunities for in-depth learning and engagement</li>

                    <h4>We started with a very broad idea of educating children about climate change about human impacts. However, there are too many factors to this idea. Then we iterated our concept to macro Impacts vs. micro Impacts about time. Implementing time element to the design somehow scope down our concept to specific human impacts to the ecosystem. Finally, we decided on the particular diorama that we wanted to address which was Allegheny National Forest ecosystem. Through our research, we found that invasive species is one of the primary human impacts that influence and damage animals habitats and environment. To help kids and parents to understand this concept, they can control time to see how invasive species affect the environment and what can they do to help in the pledge system.</h4>

After that, animated character, Ranger Joe, will introduce himself and provide instructions for the activities. </h4>

                        <h4>At first, we were targeting toward children around 5-8 years old. Our visual style and languages lean to more toddler understanding approach. As we decided to involve parents participating in the activities, our approach shifted to somewhat in between that both parents and children could understand. When we were planning our wireframes, we also got feedbacks from elementary school teachers to proofread for the contents and instruction steps.</h4>
