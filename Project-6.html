Since this is <strong> a 2-weeks project </strong>, we scope down <strong> our solution to focus on integrating a parking system to encourage users to engage in local neighborhood shopping for parking fee rebates. </strong> It also visualizes these purchases for the users as contributions to build a vibrant neighborhood. We also <strong> design for inclusivity </strong>so that people who don't own smartphones could still access to our service.</h4>
