                    <h4>As self-driving cars will be the next wave in changing the ecosystem in the shared economy and city planning within the districts,  we found that this trend will decrease the needs to have parking spaces and parking kiosks in the communities. From the interview with Director Parking and Metering of Pittsburgh, we got the insights on how most of the city government revenue is from parking fees, and these fees also go into the city for public services (i.e., street maintenance, utilities and environmental maintenance).<strong>Since this is a 2-week design sprint project, we narrow down our concepts to design for a vibrant communitywhich create an intuitive system by connecting local businesses into the parking ecosystem.</strong>For instance, if Joe parks and shops in the district, he could get the rebate for the parking fee and see the visualization on how his contribution goes into public service. As the transition with mixed of self-driving cars and regular cars in 5-7 years, we envision that this system will assist people and local businesses that are underprivileged in the future.</h4>

She worried about the<strong> transition time where mixed of autonomous cars and regular cars.</strong> We also talk to John Fournier, director at Parking & Metering in the City of Pittsburgh. He mentioned that parking fees are so important for the city government since they are <strong>one of the main revenues for the city </strong>and people is not aware how these fees are also for<strong> maintaining utilization.</strong> He said that street parking also <strong>creates a barrier for pedestrians from traffic.</strong>It creates a sense of safety. Our research shows that fewer accidents happen in these areas.</h4>

He needs to commute to Downtown Pittsburgh to work every day. He stressed about find parking spots on the street and anxious about getting tickets for not extending time. 
                        Then we mapped out Joe's commute journey from driving to work to pick up his car after work. We analyzed the pain-points in relation to his key moments and how these factors affect his stress level during the process. From there, we found opportunities to design for interventions for those pain-points. For instance, Joe needs to walk back to park spot to extend time, and he is stressful about extending parking time at work. We saw an opportunity to use we-link for the user to extend time. This gives flexibility to other users who don't want to download an app. </h4>

This not only solves the pain-points of drivers but also promote local businesses in the district. The new and fresh interface is intuitive for everyone, especially with elders who confused with current parking kiosk system. </h5>
