                    Wildlife Adventure is an interactive activity at Carnegie Museum of Natural History that <strong>utilizes augmented reality </strong> to allow visitors to discover new information about dioramas and gain a new perspective on how human impacts different ecosystems. The <strong> entire project took about a month </strong> from conducting research to presenting to Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Due to the short period, we only focus on one particular diorama ecosystem to address our concepts. <strong> We decided to tackle how invasive species affects the ecosystem as a whole in 15 years in Allegheny National Forest diorama. </strong></h4>

                    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                    <h3>We observed that there was <strong> a limited parent to child engagement in the diorama section</strong> at the museum. Through our research and interview, we found that:</h3>

                    <h4>
                    <li>Parents and children moved at <strong> different speeds </strong> throughout the exhibition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of more in-depth conversation </strong> about artifacts and further learning engagement</li> 
                    <li>Need to increase amount of information and activities provided through the <strong> use of technology</strong></li>

                    <h2>Design Principles & Implementations</h2>

                     <h3>Based on observations and discussions with museum staff and elementary school educators, we <strong> decided to focus on 5-11 years old children and their parents </strong>to utilize: </h3>

Then we iterated our concept to macro Impacts vs. micro Impacts about time. Implementing time element to the design somehow scope down our concept to specific human impacts to the ecosystem. Through our research, we found that invasive species is one of the primary human impacts that influence the ecosystem in animal's habitats.<strong> The activity allows the children to control timeline to observe how invasive species affect the environment over time and plege to help for improving the environment.</strong></h4>
